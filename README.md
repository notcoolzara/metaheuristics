# Metaheuristics Exploration

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation and exploration of metaheuristic algorithms for optimization problems. Metaheuristics are powerful optimization techniques inspired by natural phenomena, and they are widely used for solving complex problems in engineering, operations research, and artificial intelligence.

## Overview

The notebook provides a hands-on implementation of the following algorithms:

1. **Simulated Annealing**: A probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function.
2. **Genetic Algorithm**: Inspired by the process of natural selection, this algorithm evolves solutions over generations.
3. **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**: Mimics the social behavior of birds or fish to find optimal solutions.
4. **Differential Evolution (DE)**: Uses vector differences for optimization, ideal for continuous domains.

Each section in the notebook contains:
- A brief explanation of the algorithm.
- Implementation details.
- Demonstrative examples with visualizations.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `seaborn`

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy seaborn
